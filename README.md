# JAM Stack - day 1

In this lab you will get your hands dirty with the JAM Stack and get a first site up that are using the J(avaScript) A(pis) and M(arkdown).

## The exercise

Build a site with the following features:

* A landing page
* A blog page that lists all blog posts
* A page for articles that shows one blog post
* An about page with some information about the amazing people that built the site.

We will use some of the most common tools, in the JAM Stack world, to do this:

* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)  to build/generate the site
* [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) to store and deliver the content
* [Netlifly](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy the site

## The resources

Since there are so many tools involved in JAM stack setups we are not going to try to repeat a tutorial from each provider but rather let you all follow along in tutorials that are already written by the providers of the tools.

There are many good articles out there, but we suggest that you use the Gatsby-template called `contentful-starter` that sets you up for success with the setup we are using (Gatsby and Contentful).

Here are a few articles that we found useful, in different levels of completness. Chose the one that suits the mob best:

* [A tutorial setting up exactly the setup for this lab](https://alligator.io/gatsbyjs/gatsby-contentful-netlify/)
* [Another tutorial of setting up our exact stack/tooling](https://itnext.io/content-management-with-gatsby-netlify-and-contentful-70f03de41602)
* [The Gatsby Contentful starter kit](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/TRamos5/gatsby-contentful-starter/)
* [Contentful describing how to use Gatsby](https://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/gatsbyjs-and-contentful-in-five-minutes/)
* [Gatsby describing how to deploy to Netlify](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploying-to-netlify/)

One approach, to learn from tutorials, is to first follow an article blindly and get it to work, and then to really make sure that we understood it, build it by yourselves ... yes again.
